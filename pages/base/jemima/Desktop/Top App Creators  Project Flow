1) upload excel format -  csv would be fine.
2) badges details - this is a default static badge provided by the TAC to the companies registered, if a company owns any badges then we will give some points to that company, so based on that the registered company will be listed at the top.
3) chat details live chat or like a manual type - it should be like a form and if we are sending any messages then it will be notified to the admin.
4) campaign  - Monisha Devi Monisha will explain in detail.
5) email template - for now we can continue with the duplicate text.
6) details to be added to the registration page - filters - we need to add the same fields to the registration that are all required in the filters.
7) review email send or not - The company should receive an email if they got a new review.
8) review to the own company - this is not allowed.
9) blog management fields - for now we have to set it as a static page with Title, description, and image fields.
