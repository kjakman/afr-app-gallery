					<h4><b>Payment of fees</b></h4>					
					<p>The use of certain services may be subject to payment of particular fees, as determined by vPatina in its sole discretion (“Paid Services” and “Fee(s)”, respectively). vPatina will provide notice of such Fees then in effect in relation to such Paid Services. If you wish to receive or use such Paid Services, you are required to pay all applicable Fees in advance.</p>
					<p>vPatina reserves the right to change its Fees at any time, upon notice to you if such change may affect your existing subscriptions. If you received a discount or other promotional offer, vPatina shall have the right to automatically and without notice renew your subscription to such vPatina Service(s) at the full applicable Fee.</p>
					<p>All Fees shall be deemed to be in Euros, except as specifically stated otherwise in writing by vPatina. To the extent permitted by law (and unless specified otherwise by vPatina in writing), all Fees are exclusive of all taxes (including value added tax, sales tax, goods and services tax, etc.), levies or duties imposed by taxing authorities (“Taxes”), and you shall be responsible for payment of all applicable Taxes relating to your use of the vPatina Services, or to any payments or purchases made by you. If vPatina is obligated to collect or pay Taxes for the Fees payable by you, and whether or not such Taxes were added and collected from you for previous transactions, such Taxes may be added to the payment of any outstanding Fees and will be reflected in the Invoice for such transaction. We recommend that you verify the existence of any additional fees you may be charged by third parties in connection with the purchase of Paid Services or in connection with the renewal thereof (such as international transaction fees, currency exchange fees or fees due to banks or credit card companies). vPatina is not responsible for any such additional fees or costs.</p>
					<p>As part of registering or submitting information to receive Paid Services, you also authorize vPatina (either directly or through its affiliates, subsidiaries or other third parties) to request and collect payment (or otherwise charge, refund or take any other billing actions) from our payment provider or your designated banking account, and to make any inquiries VPatina or its affiliates may consider necessary to validate your designated payment account or financial information, in order to ensure prompt payment, including for the purpose of receiving updated payment details from your payment, credit card or banking account provider (e.g., updated expiry date or card number as may be provided to us by your credit card company).</p>
					<h4><b>Invoices</b></h4>
					<p>vPatina and/or its affiliated companies will issue an invoice or credit memo for any payment of Fees or refund made to or by VPatina (“Invoice”). Each Invoice will be issued in electronic form and based on the country stated in your billing address, and will be made available to you via your User Account and/or by e-mail. For the purpose of issuing the Invoice, you may be required to furnish certain Personal Information (as such term is defined in the Privacy Policy) in order to comply with local laws. Please note that the Invoice presented in your User Account may be inadequate with your local law requirements, and in such case may be used for pro forma purposes only.</p>

					<h4><b>Subscriptions & Auto Renewals</b></h4>
					<p>In order to ensure that you do not experience any interruption or loss of services due to the lapse of any particular subscription period, the VPatina Services operate with automatic renewal, on a recurring-fees basis (except where explicitly stated otherwise by VPatina in writing). Accordingly, where applicable, VPatina will attempt to automatically renew the applicable VPatina Service(s) for a renewal period equal in time to the original subscription period for such Service, and automatically charge you the applicable Fees using the payment method you have on file with vPatina.</p>
					<p>For example, if the original subscription period for a Service is one month, each of its renewal periods (where applicable) will be for one month. Therefore, unless you cancel the applicable vPatina Service(s), vPatina will automatically renew such Service when it comes up for renewal, and charge you the applicable recurring Fees. In order to avoid any interruptions or loss of services due to failure to process renewal charges prior to the expiration of the subscription period then in effect, we reserve our right (but shall not be obligated) to charge for the upcoming renewal period up to two (2) weeks before such renewal period actually commences. In the event of failure to collect the Fees owed by you, we may in our sole discretion (but shall not be obligated to) retry to collect on a later time, and/or suspend or cancel your User Account, without further notice.</p>
					<p>Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the foregoing, you are and shall be solely responsible to verify and ensure the successful renewal of the vPatina Services you use (whether or not such VPatina Services are subject to automatic subscription renewals). Accordingly, you shall be solely responsible with respect to any discontinuation of any VPatina Services previously purchased by you, including due to a cancellation, failure to charge the applicable recurring Fees, or due to any VPatina Services not being subject to automatic subscription renewals. You acknowledge and agree that you shall not have any claims against VPatina in relation to the discontinuation of any vPatina Services or Third Party Services, for whatever reason.</p> 

					<h4><b>Termination of Paid Services</b></h4>
