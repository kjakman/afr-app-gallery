            <p>Our mission is to make sure specialised digital tools are available to all artists and galleries that need them, because we don't believe curation should be dominated by those with access to advanced technology.
            </p>
            <p>We see a future where all artists have access to the tools to promote and protect their work that leading galleries, publishers, record labels and film studios currently have. </p>
            <p>Our goal is not to become a Facebook, LinkedIn or Twitter for art, or to replace the websites curators and artists already have and the web designers they work with. We don't want to promote the mass production or mass consumption of art, or to undermine the valuable role that galleries already play in supporting artists and helping art collectors explore and develop their sensibilities.</p>
            <p>Through creating tools that enable everyone to create a "Virtual Patina," to share their images and videos, protect them and connect and engage more closely with collectors, we believe we can play a small part in creating a world that is more vibrant.</p>
